This project used SQL exploratory data analysis on Mint Classicsâ€™ inventory and sales data 
to identify slow-moving products, inventory distribution, and warehouse utilization. 
Key findings reveal opportunities for warehouse consolidation and inventory reduction without compromising customer service.

Using targeted SQL queries, I analyzed product distribution across warehouses, compared inventory levels to sales, and identified non-performing items. This data-driven approach highlighted opportunities to eliminate underused warehouses, reduce overstocked products, and discontinue items with no sales. The solution aligns with project goals by maintaining customer service levels while optimizing storage efficiency and reducing operational costs.

Approach :

1.Imported the Mint Classics database into MySQL Workbench.

2.Explored schema and data to understand tables and relationships.

3.Used simple SQL queries to assess inventory distribution by warehouse.

4.Compared inventory counts with sales data to evaluate stock appropriateness.

5.Identified slow-moving or non-selling products as candidates for removal.

6.Synthesized insights into actionable recommendations for warehouse consolidation and inventory trimming

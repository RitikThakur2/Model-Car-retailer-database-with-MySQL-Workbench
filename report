This report presents an in-depth analysis of the Mint Classics Company's inventory across warehouses, the relationship between inventory levels and sales performance, and identification of non-moving or slow-moving products. The findings provide clear opportunities for warehouse consolidation, inventory reduction, and improved stock management to reduce costs while maintaining timely customer service.

1. Inventory Distribution by Warehouse
Source: inventory_by_warehouse.sql
A summary of product counts and total inventory quantity per warehouse reveals how items are distributed.
Key metrics:
Warehouse A (East) holds the most unique products and inventory.
Warehouse B (South) has the fewest products and lowest total inventory.
Insight: Warehouse B's comparatively low product variety and stock volume suggest it may be possible to eliminate or repurpose this facility by redistributing stock to other warehouses.

2. Sales vs. Inventory Analysis
Source: inventory_vs_sales.sql
This analysis compares total quantity sold per product against current inventory stock levels.
Observations:
Many high-sales products maintain appropriate or slightly high stock levels, supporting prompt order fulfillment.
Some products have large inventories but correspondingly low sales, indicating potential overstock.
Implication: By adjusting stock levels to better align with sales velocity, the company can reduce unnecessary inventory holding costs without risking stockouts on fast-moving items.

3. Identification of Slow-Moving or Non-Moving Items
Source: slow_movers.sql
Products with zero recorded sales but existing inventory were isolated as prime candidates for removal or discounting, freeing up valuable warehouse space.
Examples include classic models with units still in stock but no sales activity, suggesting customer demand is lacking.
Recommendation: These items should be evaluated for discontinuation, liquidation, or promotional clearance to optimize inventory footprint.
Expanding the threshold could identify slow movers (1985 Toyota Supra 0 units sold), enabling a more nuanced approach to inventory rationalization.

Business Recommendations:--
1.Warehouse Consolidation:
Consider closing or repurposing Warehouse B (South) due to low inventory and product variety, potentially relocating stock to larger facilities to reduce overheads.
2.Inventory Rationalization:
Remove or redistribute products with no sales, especially those with significant stock quantities, to minimize carrying costs and free warehouse space. Here 1985 Toyota Supra whose  0 units are sold needs to be be optimised
3.Stock Level Optimization:
Adjust inventory levels of products where stock significantly exceeds sales to avoid overstocking, while ensuring fast sellers maintain sufficient availability for 24-hour order fulfillment.
4.Data-Driven Monitoring:
Establish ongoing monitoring mechanisms using similar SQL queries to continuously identify slow-moving items and warehouse utilization for proactive inventory management.
